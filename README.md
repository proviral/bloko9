## Simplifed Code for Bloko 9

I am fairly new to this and I thought that this would help get you started if you're in the same boat as me.

## Helpful Link

I use Mu Editor for editing code and running code on the Pi Pico (https://codewith.mu/)

This YouTube video was very helpful when getting started with Pi Pico development (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMh-GYZYDU)

## Prerequisites

Print the Bloko9 and put it together. (https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/bloko-9-pico)

Put CircuitPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico (https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)

Download the Adafruit HID Library and put it into the lib folder that is created when putting CircuitPython on your Pi Pico (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HID)

## Code

Download the code and put it at the root of the CircuitPy folder that was made when installing CircuitPython on your Pi Pico

## Help

Again, I am very new to coding in Circuit Python so I would love to get some pointers on the code. Hope this was a helpful guide and the code helped a little!
